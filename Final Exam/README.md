1b-ii: again, entirely missing a proof. -7.5

2.a) j should be the target value not the size.

2.b) K(i,j) = {  
infinity 	if i = 0 or j = 0;  
min{K(i-1,j),w_i)	if v_i > j;  
min{K(i-1,j-v_i)+w_i, K(i-1,j)} otherwise  
}  

3 - The construction is not clear.

4b - You have not mentioned a single dummy vertex connected to s in the reduction.
If you add n dummy vertices to s, any Hamiltonian Path must include all these dummy vertices and such a path will not exist.  

5. Wrong algorithm. -10
